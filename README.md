 # __x9k3__ 
 __HLS Segmenter__ with __SCTE-35__ baked in.   

* SCTE-35 Cues in __Mpegts Streams__ are Translated into HLS tags.
* Segments are __Split on SCTE-35 Cues__ as needed.
* M3U8 Manifests are created with __SCTE-35 HLS tags__.
* Supports __h264__ and __h265__(hevc)
* __Multi-protocol.__ Files, Http(s), Multicast, and Udp.
* Built using the highest rated SCTE-35 lib on the Planet, [__threefive__](https://github.com/futzu/scte35-threefive)

# Clean Code.
* This code is cleaner than your dishes.
